    <h1>Ansible Tutorial</h1>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p class="outer">
        Configuration management systems are designed to make controlling large numbers of servers easy for administrators and operations teams.
     They allow you to control many different systems in an automated way from one central location.
While there are many popular configuration management systems available for Linux systems, such as Chef and Puppet, these are often more complex than many people want or need.
 Ansible is a great alternative to these options because it requires a much smaller overhead to get started.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 1: Installing Ansible</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        To begin using Ansible as a means of managing your various servers, you need to install the Ansible software on at least one machine.
To get the latest version of Ansible for Ubuntu, you can add the project's PPA (personal package archive) to your system. Before doing this, though, you should first update your package index and install the software-properties-common package. This software will make it easier to manage this and other independent software repositories:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        sudo apt update


sudo apt install software-properties-common

            </div>
            <p class="inner">
                Then add the Ansible PPA by typing the following command:</p>
<div class="code">
                sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible</div>


<p class="inner">Press ENTER to accept the PPA addition.
Next, refresh your system's package index once again so that it is aware of the packages available in the PPA:</p>
<div class="code">sudo apt update</div>


<p class="inner">Following this update, you can install the Ansible software:</p>
<h4>Step 2: Configuring SHS Access to Ansible Hosts</h4>
<p class="inner">As mentioned previously, Ansible primarily communicates with client computers through SSH. While it certainly has the ability to handle password-based SSH authentication, using SSH keys can help to keep things simple.
    On your Ansible server, use the cat command to print the contents of your non-root user’s SSH public key file to the terminal’s output:
    </p>
    <div class="code">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</div>
    <p class="inner">Copy the resulting output to your clipboard, then open a new terminal and connect to one of your Ansible hosts using SSH:</p>
    <div class="code">ssh sammy@ansible_host_ip</div>
    <p class="inner">Switch to the client machine’s root user:
    </p>
    <div class="code">su -</div>
    <p class="inner">As the root user, open the authorized_keys within the ~/.ssh directory:</p>
    <div class="code">nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</div>
    <p class="inner">In the file, paste your Ansible server user’s SSH key, then save the file and close the editor (press CTRL + X, Y, then ENTER). Then run the exit command to return to the host’s non-root user:</p>
<div class="code">exit</div>
    <h4>Step 3: Setting up Ansible Hosts</h4>
    <p class="inner">Ansible keeps track of all of the servers that it knows about through a hosts file. We need to set up this file first before we can begin to communicate with our other computers.
        Open the file with sudo privileges, like this:</p>
        <div class="code">sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts</div>
        <p class="inner">Inside the file, you will see a number of example configurations that have been commented out (with a #preceding each line). These examples won’t actually work for us since the hosts listed in each one are made up. We will, however, keep these examples in the file to help us with configuration if we want to implement more complex scenarios in the future.
            The hosts file is fairly flexible and can be configured in a few different ways. The syntax we are going to use, though, looks like this:</p>
<div class="code">[group_name]
    alias ansible_ssh_host=your_server_ip
    </div>
    <p class="inner">In this example, group_name is an organizational tag that lets you refer to any servers listed under it with one word, while alias is just a name to refer to one specific server.
        So, in our scenario, we are imagining that we have three servers we are going to control with Ansible. At this point, these servers are accessible from the Ansible server by typing:
        </p>
        <div class="code">ssh root@ansible_host_ip
        </div>
        <p class="inner">You should not be prompted for a password if you have set this up correctly. For the purpose of demonstration, we will assume that our hosts' IP addresses are 203.0.113.1, 203.0.113.2, and 203.0.113.3. We will set this up so that we can refer to these individually as host1, host2, and host3, or as a group with the name servers.
            This is the block that we should add to our hosts file to accomplish this:
            </p>
            <div class="code">/etc/ansible/hosts
                [servers]
                host1 ansible_ssh_host=203.0.113.1
                host2 ansible_ssh_host=203.0.113.2
                host3 ansible_ssh_host=203.0.113.3
                </div>
            <h4>Step 4: Using Ansible Commands</h4>
            <p class="inner">Now that we have our hosts set up and enough configuration details to allow us to successfully connect to our hosts, we can try out our very first command.
                Ping all of the servers you configured by typing:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    ansible -m ping all


Ping output
host1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

host3 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

host2 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
                </div>
    <p class="inner">This is a basic test to make sure that Ansible has a connection to all of its hosts.
        The all means all hosts. We could just as easily specify a group:</p>
        <div class="code">ansible -m ping servers
        </div>
        <p class="inner">We could also specify an individual host:
        </p>
        <div class="code">ansible -m ping host1</div>
        <p class="inner">We can specify multiple hosts by separating them with colons:</p>
<div class="code">ansible -m ping host1:host2</div>
<p class="inner"> The -m ping portion of the command is an instruction to Ansible to use the "ping" module. These are basically commands that you can run on your remote hosts. The ping module operates in many ways like the normal ping utility in Linux, but instead it checks for Ansible connectivity.
    The ping module doesn't really take any arguments, but we can try another command to see how that works. We pass arguments into a script by typing -a.
    The "shell" module lets us send a terminal command to the remote host and retrieve the results. For instance, to find out the memory usage on our host1 machine, we could use:
    </p>
    <div class="code">ansible -m shell -a 'free -m' host1


        Shell output
        host1 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
                     total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
        Mem:          3954        227       3726          0         14         93
        -/+ buffers/cache:        119       3834
        Swap:            0          0          0
        </div>
        <p class="inner">With that, your Ansible server configured and you can successfully communicate and control your hosts.</p>
                <h3>Modules</h3>
    <p class="outer"></p>
    <h3>Playbooks</h3>
    <p class="outer">
        Playbooks are the basis for configuration, and multi-machine deployment. Playbooks can declare configuration, 
        but can also control flow between ordered steps that must bounce back and forth between multiple machines, 
        they can be used to launch tasks synchronously or asynchronously. Playbooks are often kept in source control,
        and are used to push out configuration to new machines. Playbooks are files which are written using YAML, each playbook
        contains one or more plays. A play maps a group of hosts to Ansible tasks, and tasks in their simplest form are calls to modules.
    </p>
    <h4>Plays</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        The beginning of a play is used to specify on which hosts to run the tasks, and with what user. 
        The following play will be run on the hosts in the webservers group, as the root user.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
- hosts: webservers
remote_user: root
    </div>
    <p class="inner">
        Each play also contains a list of tasks. Each task is run sequentially in the order that it is listed, one at a time,
        on all the machines that were specified for this play. If a task fails on a host, then the host is removed for the rest
        of the play, thus it will not receive any more commands to run. All modules that are run in a playbook, should be idempotent,
        and thus the playbook as a whole should be idempotent and running it multiple times should leave the machines in the desired state.
    </p>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        A task begins with a human readable name to describe what the task does. Following the name, the task specifies a module to run.
        Example:
    <p>
    <div class="code">
tasks:
- name: make sure apache is running
  service:
     name: httpd
     state: started      
    </div>
    <p class="inner">
        A task can also notify a handler when it is done. All handlers will be executed after all of the tasks in a play have completed,
        and no matter how many times a handler is notified in a task it will only run the handler once.
        Example task with notify:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
- name: template configuration file
  template:
  src: template.j2
  dest: /etc/foo.conf
  notify:
- restart memcached
- restart apache
    </div>
    <p class="inner">
        Handlers are lists of tasks, not really any different from regular tasks,
        that are referenced by a globally unique name, and are notified by notifiers. 
    </p>
    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <p class="outer"></p>
    <h3>Possible Use Cases</h3>
        <h4>Provisioning</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        From traditional bare metal through to serverless or function-as-a-service, automating the provisioning of any infrastructure is the first step in automating the operational life cycle of your applications. Ansible can provision the latest cloud platforms, virtualized hosts and hypervisors, network devices and bare-metal servers.
    </p>
        <p class="inner">
        Ansible becomes the connecting tool in any of your process pipelines – taking bare infrastructure right through to day to day management, automatically. Provisioning with Ansible allows you to seamlessly transition into configuration management, orchestration and application deployment using the same simple, human readable, automation language.
    </p>
            <h4>Configuration Management</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        Centralizing configuration file management and deployment is a common use case for Ansible, and it’s how many power users are first introduced to the Ansible automation platform. Ansible makes it automation accessible, goal-oriented, not scripted, secure and agentless.
    </p>

    </p>
                <h4>Application Deployment</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        When you define your application with Ansible, and manage the deployment with Ansible Tower, teams are able to effectively manage the entire application lifecycle from development to production.
    </p>
            <p class="inner">

    </p>

                <h4>Continuous Delivery</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        Creating a CI/CD pipeline requires buy-in from numerous teams. You can’t do it without a simple automation platform that everyone in your organization can use. Ansible Playbooks keep your applications properly deployed (and managed) throughout their entire lifecycle.
    </p>
            <p class="inner">
    <img src="https://www.ansible.com/hs-fs/hub/330046/file-476047569.png?width=1650&name=file-476047569.png">
    </p>

                <h4>Security & Compliance</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        When you define your security policy in Ansible, scanning and remediation of site-wide security policy can be integrated into other automated processes and instead of being an afterthought, it’ll be integral in everything that is deployed.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">
        Writing automation content to secure your systems doesn’t help if you don’t have a secure automation framework to begin with. Ansible’s agentless nature means you don’t need a separate security policy for your automation. There’s no ports to open, no additional policy to write - Ansible works with your existing SSH and WinRM infrastructure.
    </p>
        <p class="inner">
        If you want to verify your automation outside of your automation, Ansible’s task-based nature makes it easy to write content using tools such as OpenSCAP and STIGMA to verify your automation. And Ansible Tower’s fact gathering can be directly integrated with common logging and analytics providers to build a wealth of data on your infrastructure, allowing you to simply see any deviations in your systems.
    </p>

                    <h4>Orchestration</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        Configurations alone don’t define your environment. You need to define how multiple configurations interact and ensure the disparate pieces can be managed as a whole. Out of complexity and chaos, Ansible brings order.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">
        Ansible’s library of modules and easy extensibility, makes it simple to orchestrate different conductors in different environments, all using one simple language. Your admins don’t need to remember 12 different syntaxes - now they can concentrate on one.
