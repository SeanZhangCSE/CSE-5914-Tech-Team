    <h3>Playbooks</h3>
    <p class="outer">
        Playbooks are the basis for configuration, and multi-machine deployment. Playbooks can declare configuration, 
        but can also control flow between ordered steps that must bounce back and forth between multiple machines, 
        they can be used to launch tasks synchronously or asynchronously. Playbooks are often kept in source control,
        and are used to push out configuration to new machines. Playbooks are files which are written using YAML, each playbook
        contains one or more plays. A play maps a group of hosts to Ansible tasks, and tasks in their simplest form are calls to modules.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Plays</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        The beginning of a play is used to specify on which hosts to run the tasks, and with what user. 
        The following play will be run on the hosts in the webservers group, as the root user.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
- hosts: webservers
remote_user: root
    </div>
    <p class="inner">
        Each play also contains a list of tasks. Each task is run sequentially in the order that it is listed, one at a time,
        on all the machines that were specified for this play. If a task fails on a host, then the host is removed for the rest
        of the play, thus it will not receive any more commands to run. All modules that are run in a playbook, should be idempotent,
        and thus the playbook as a whole should be idempotent and running it multiple times should leave the machines in the desired state.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <p class="inner">
        A task begins with a human readable name to describe what the task does. Following the name, the task specifies a module to run.
        Example:
    <p>
    <div class="code">
tasks:
- name: make sure apache is running
  service:
     name: httpd
     state: started      
    </div>
    <p class="inner">
        A task can also notify a handler when it is done. All handlers will be executed after all of the tasks in a play have completed,
        and no matter how many times a handler is notified in a task it will only run the handler once.
        Example task with notify:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
- name: template configuration file
  template:
  src: template.j2
  dest: /etc/foo.conf
  notify:
- restart memcached
- restart apache
    </div>
    <p class="inner">
        Handlers are lists of tasks, not really any different from regular tasks,
        that are referenced by a globally unique name, and are notified by notifiers. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Modules</h3>
    <div class="inner">
        Modules (also referred to as "task plugins" or "library plugins" are descrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task. Modules support taking arguments and most follow a key-value format. All modules return JSON format data. Modules should be idempotent and hsould only run if current state != desired state.
        <br><br>
        Command Line Example:
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        $ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
        $ ansible webservers ping
        $ ansible webservers -m command -a "/sbin/reboot -t now"
    </div>
    <div class="inner">
        <br>
        Playbook Example:
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        name: reboot the servers
        action: command /sbin/reboot -t now
    </div>
    <div class="inner">
        <br>
        Yaml Example:
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        name: restart webserver
        service:
            name: httpd
            state: restarted
    </div>
    <div class="inner">
        <br>
        Remember: the real power of Ansible comes from using modules in playbooks, but quick, one-time task may u\
se Ad-Hoc commands with ease.
